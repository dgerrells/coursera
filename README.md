# coursera
Repo containing my work on various coursera classes.

## Structure 

Each folder will contain the work related to a given course. This could be homework, practice, etc. The work will be broken up into a folder for each assignment.

## Coursera Honor Code

Note that the code here should NOT be directly used for any Coursera class as it goes against the honor code and defeats the purpose of learning the material. I do not claim that any of the work here is sufficient for full credit in the respective course and should only be used for reference.
